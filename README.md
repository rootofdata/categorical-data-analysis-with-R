categorical data analysis with R

I conducted a project focusing on the analysis of qualitative data commonly encountered in social sciences and medicine. The project delved into classical tests, measures, and models for data presented in 2D and 3D contingency tables. Topics covered included logistic regression models, log-linear models, and other advanced techniques. Through this project, in-depth analysis of qualitative or categorical data was facilitated.

The project encompassed the following topics:

1. Categorical Data, 2x2 Contingency Tables, Odds Ratio  
Measures of association: Relevance measures, odds ratio

2. 2x2 contingency tables: Independence testing (Categorical data and ordinal data)  
Fisher's exact test

3. 3D Contingency Tables: Conditional Independence and Homogeneous Association Testing  
Partial association, Simpson's paradox  
Mantel-Haenszel's conditional independence testing  

4. Link Function  
Generalized linear models (GLM), Generalized linear models for binomial data: Logistic regression  
Generalized linear models for frequency data: Poisson regression  

5. Deviance  
Model validity checks: Wald test, Likelihood-ratio test, score test  
Fitting generalized linear models: Newton-Raphson algorithm, Deviance  

6. Retrospective Study  
Interpretation and inference of logistic regression models  

7. Logistic Regression Models  
Logit models for qualitative independent variables  

8. Multiple Logistic Regression  
Logistic regression models for multiple independent variables  

9. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test)  
Model selection techniques  

10. Sparse Table  
Analysis of sparse contingency tables  

11. Proportional Odds Model   
Polytomous logit models: Nominal and ordinal response variables  

12. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test  
Conditional independence testing using models  

13. Log-Linear Models (Optional)  
Log-linear models: Two-dimensional, three-dimensional, multidimensional (optional)  


Through this comprehensive project, I gained a deep understanding of qualitative and categorical data analysis, employing various classical methods and advanced models.
